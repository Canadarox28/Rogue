# Rogue

### This project is currently deprecated, and a new version will be started soon using the Unity engine

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

## Description
The Rogue Engine is a Angular2-based RPG-style text adventure which attempts to accurately represent Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition rules for combat and skill challenges. The goal of this project is to create an engine which can take JSON objects which contain actual story content, and resources such as items and enemies. These JSON files will be created by users and imported to the engine, so that many stories can be written by developers, and a community could be founded to share stories among one another. Eventually, a UI to ease the creation of such scripts will be created.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
